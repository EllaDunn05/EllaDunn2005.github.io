			  <p>Ingredients:

1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 lemon, juiced and zested
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon paprika
Salt and pepper, to taste
Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
Instructions:

Preheat the Oven:

Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
Prepare the Shrimp and Asparagus:

Place the peeled and deveined shrimp and trimmed asparagus on a large baking sheet.
Make the Garlic Butter Sauce:

In a small bowl, whisk together the melted butter, olive oil, minced garlic, lemon juice, lemon zest, dried oregano, paprika, salt, and pepper.
Coat Shrimp and Asparagus:

Pour half of the garlic butter sauce over the shrimp and asparagus. Toss to coat evenly.
Bake:

Spread the shrimp and asparagus in a single layer on the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the shrimp are pink and opaque, and the asparagus is tender.
Broil (Optional):

For a slightly crispy texture, you can broil the shrimp and asparagus for an additional 2-3 minutes until they get a golden color.
Serve:

Remove from the oven, drizzle the remaining garlic butter sauce over the top, and garnish with chopped fresh parsley.
Enjoy:

Serve the baked lemon garlic butter shrimp and asparagus over rice, quinoa, or your favorite grain. Squeeze additional lemon juice if desired.
This Baked Lemon Garlic Butter Shrimp with Asparagus is a delightful and light summer dish that combines the sweetness of shrimp with the freshness of asparagus. It's quick to prepare and perfect for a weeknight dinner or a gathering with friends and family. </p>
